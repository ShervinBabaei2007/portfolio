                Lionel Messi Reaches New International Milestone in Argentina's Victory Over Angola
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                In Argentina’s 2–0 win against Angola at the Estádio 11 de Novembro, Lionel Messi recorded both a goal
                and an assist, marking another milestone in his international career (Langell).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                The assist, delivered to Lautaro Martínez in the 43rd minute, represents Messi’s ninth career assist to
                the Inter striker, matching his record for the most assists to a single teammate, a mark he previously
                reached with Gonzalo Higuaín and Sergio Agüero (Langell).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Just one more assist to Martínez would set Messi apart, adding another record to his illustrious career,
                which already includes consecutive Copa América titles and the 2022 FIFA World Cup victory (Langell).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Messi, who has now scored 115 goals in 187 appearances for Argentina, will need to wait until the new
                year to attempt to surpass his personal record for assists, after Argentina’s friendly with Australia
                scheduled for November 17 was postponed (Langell).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Despite only appearing once during the November international window, Messi’s performance was historic:
                he both assisted Martínez and scored his 115th international goal in the 82nd minute (Langell).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Following the international break, Messi will shift focus to Inter Miami as the club aims for its first
                MLS Cup. Inter Miami advanced past Nashville SC in the opening round of the 2025 MLS Cup playoffs and
                will face FC Cincinnati in the Eastern Conference semifinals on November 23. With 20 goal contributions
                in his last eight matches across club and country, Messi is expected to play a pivotal role in leading
                Inter Miami to their first-ever conference final and potentially earning back-to-back MLS MVP honors
                (Langell).

            <h2>Fun Facts About Soccer</h2>
            <h3 class="author">Author: Shervin Babaei</h3>

            <div class="content">
              <p class="bold-heading">10 Fun and Surprising Facts About Soccer</p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world, and there are plenty of cool facts that most
                players and fans might not know. Even though the rules look simple, the history and details behind the
                game are full of interesting surprises. From record-breaking players to unusual traditions, soccer has
                grown into a sport that brings millions of people together (Babaei, 2025).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                One of the craziest facts about soccer is how massive the FIFA World Cup actually was. There were more
                than 3 billion people who watched the 2022 World Cup — that’s almost half of everyone on the planet! The
                final between Argentina and France alone had over a billion viewers. This makes the World Cup the single
                most-watched sporting event in the whole world, even bigger than the Olympics (Babaei, 2025).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Another fun fact is that soccer fields aren’t all exactly the same size. The rules allow fields to be
                anywhere between 100–130 yards long and 50–100 yards wide. Coaches even choose strategies based on the
                size of the field, which can make a big difference in how the game feels (Babaei, 2025).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Some players have also made unforgettable records. For example, Cristiano Ronaldo is the first male
                player to score over 120 international goals, while Lionel Messi has won the most Ballon d'Or awards,
                with eight wins. Watching these two legends play at the same time is something future generations might
                never see again (Babaei, 2025).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Finally, soccer even has some weird rules and traditions. For example, the referee’s whistle was not
                always used. Before whistles were invented, referees raised a handkerchief to stop the game! Another
                unusual rule is that a goalkeeper can be given a yellow card for wasting too much time. Rules like these
                keep the game fair and fast-paced (Babaei, 2025).

            <h2>Best Young Players in the World 2025</h2>
            <h3 class="author">Author: Alex Harris, Ned Holmes</h3>

            <div class="content">
              <p class="bold-heading">
                A new wave of young football stars is reshaping the game in 2025. These players may be under 23, but
                they’re already delivering world-class performances for club and country (Harris & Holmes).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Among the rising stars, several young players have already made significant impacts in Europe’s biggest
                leagues. Talents such as Désiré Doué at PSG and Estevão at Chelsea are demonstrating exceptional skill,
                with Doué showcasing explosive pace and Estevão standing out for his fearless, direct style of play
                (Harris & Holmes).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Warren Zaïre-Emery, also at PSG, has already amassed over 140 appearances despite being only 19, proving
                himself a formidable presence in midfield and a future serial trophy winner (Harris & Holmes).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Other notable names include Jamal Musiala of Bayern Munich and Florian Wirtz of Bayer Leverkusen.
                Musiala continues to impress as an attacking midfielder for Germany and Bayern, while Wirtz, recently
                signed by Liverpool, showed his class during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga campaign (Harris &
                Holmes).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Defensive talents like Pau Cubarsi at Barcelona and João Neves at PSG are also making waves. Cubarsi
                excels as a young centre-back with excellent game reading and distribution skills, and Neves dominates
                as a defensive midfielder with impressive possession and agility (Harris & Holmes).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                At the very top is Barcelona’s Lamine Yamal, the standout young talent of 2025. Already commanding
                attention for both club and country at just 18, Yamal combines skill, maturity, and a growing trophy
                collection, cementing his status as the best young footballer in the world (Harris & Holmes).

            <h2>Soccer Tech and Analytics: How Clubs Are Using Data to Find the Next Star</h2>
            <h3 class="author">Author: AnalyiSport</h3>
            <h4 class="publication">May 6, 2022</h4>

              <p class="bold-heading">Who Are Football’s Star Data Analysts?</p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Many people know famous football players like Mo Salah, Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi, or great coaches like
                Jürgen Klopp. But not many know about the data analysts who help teams win from behind the scenes. These
                people study numbers, videos, and player movements to help coaches make smart decisions (AnalyiSport).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Football clubs today collect huge amounts of information every time players train or play a match.
                Cameras and GPS trackers record how fast players run, where they move, when they pass, shoot, or tackle.
                Experts say that more than 2,000 pieces of data are recorded in every match, plus 1.5 million tracking
                points about player movement (AnalyiSport).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                One of the best-known data experts is Ian Graham, who leads the data department at Liverpool FC. His
                team helps clubs sign great players and build strong tactics using smart data analysis (AnalyiSport).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Graham and his team use formulas like “goal probability added” to evaluate each player’s impact on
                scoring chances. This helps teams find underrated players who are better than they first appear
                (AnalyiSport).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Liverpool isn’t the only club investing in data experts. Manchester City also hires top scientists,
                including those from Harvard or even government work, to stay ahead (AnalyiSport).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Experts believe data analysts will become even more important, potentially advising coaches in real time
                during matches. Their work is changing football behind the scenes (AnalyiSport).
