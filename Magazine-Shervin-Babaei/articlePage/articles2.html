              <p class="bold-heading">10 Fun and Surprising Facts About Soccer</p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world, and there are plenty of cool facts that most
                players and fans might not know. Even though the rules look simple, the history and details behind the
                game are full of interesting surprises. From record-breaking players to unusual traditions, soccer has
                grown into a sport that brings millions of people together (Babaei, 2025).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                One of the craziest facts about soccer is how massive the FIFA World Cup actually was. There were more
                than 3 billion people who watched the 2022 World Cup, that’s almost half of everyone on the planet! The
                final between Argentina and France alone had over a billion viewers. This makes the World Cup the single
                most-watched sporting event in the whole world, even bigger than the Olympics (Babaei, 2025).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Another fun fact is that soccer fields aren’t all exactly the same size. The rules allow fields to be
                anywhere between 100–130 yards long and 50–100 yards wide. Coaches even choose strategies based on the
                size of the field, which can make a big difference in how the game feels (Babaei, 2025).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Some players have also made unforgettable records. For example, Cristiano Ronaldo is the first male
                player to score over 120 international goals, while Lionel Messi has won the most Ballon d'Or awards,
                with eight wins. Watching these two legends play at the same time is something future generations might
                never see again (Babaei, 2025).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Finally, soccer even has some weird rules and traditions. For example, the referee’s whistle was not always used.
                Before whistles were invented, referees raised a handkerchief to stop the game! Another unusual rule is
                that a goalkeeper can be given a yellow card for wasting too much time. Rules like these keep the game
                fair and fast-paced (Babaei, 2025).
